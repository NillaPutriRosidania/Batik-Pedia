## About Project
BatikPedia is an application that applies artificial intelligence to classify types of batik based on images and its pattern details. 
With the interactive exploration function, it will help people, especially the younger generation, to easily recognize and learn about the different kinds of batik.

## Abstract

Batik is one of the identities of the Indonesian nation designated by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, proving that batik has become a form of Indonesian cultural wealth that should be preserved. In 2015, the Bandung Fe Institute and Sobat Budaya research found that Indonesia had around 5,849 batik motifs. So, the idea of creating the BatikPedia application emerged.
